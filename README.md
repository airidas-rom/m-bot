My own made mineflayer bot for minecraft

!!! This is my own made minecraft project using mineflayer library, this project is unfinished, and might be never finished. But maybe
in the future i'll finish it at some point.

My made mineflayer bot for minecraft, the bot includes functions like:
All bots connect
Single bot connect
Selected bots connect
// "all" - connects all bots in the list
// "1:4" - connects bots from 1 to 4 in the list
// "1" or "1, 4, 5" - connects bot with a specified num, multiple is possible

The bot is able to reconnect(althought the bot's won't react to command's after reconnecting.(That's the part i couldn't fix))
The commands work for all of the bot's, but you can specify the bot name to target specific bot, like this "<bot_username> <command>"

The bot is able to come to your location with command "come"

They are able to align by your given commands(align <direction>)
Available directions: north, south west, east, northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast.

You can also say hello to the bots with command "everyone hello" or "<bot_username> hello"

The bot's are able to collect specified block(although it's sometimes(a lot of time) buggy.)
The command for it is "collect <minecraft_block> <amount>" (targeting bot not available)
The amount isn't neccessary.

The bot's are also able to fish, altough  it's also a bit broken, as the bots are unable to find the water block.
You can make bot's fish by command "<bot_username> start fishing" or stop fishing by command: "<bot_username> stop fishing"
You can make all of the bot's fish by command: "start fishing" or stop by "everyone stop fishing"

The bot's can also slap a player(you)/(hit them) by command: "slap" (targeting bot not available)

The bot's can also sleep wand wake up by command: "sleep" or to wake up by command "wakeup" (targeting bot not available)

The bot's can also farm, by command "<bot_username> farm" or for everyone to farm simply "everyone farm"
The bot's will replace the broken seed into it's place
The bot in the version it was created could farm wheat, carrots and potatoes
To stop the bot from farming you can use command "<bot_username> stop" or simply "stop" to stop all bots
